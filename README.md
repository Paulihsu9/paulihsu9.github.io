**From Seattle Vision**

- How can one sell the air?
- Every part of this earth is sacred to my people.
- Every shining pine needle, every tender shore,every vapor in the dark woods, every clearing, and every humming insect are holy in the memory and experience of my people.
- The sap which courses through the trees carries the memories of the red man.
